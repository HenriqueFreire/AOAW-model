# Project Setup and Execution with Nix

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run this project using Nix and the provided `shell.nix` file.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Install Nix:**
    If you don't have Nix installed, follow the instructions on the [official Nix website](https://nixos.org/download.html). The multi-user installation is generally recommended.

## Entering the Development Environment

Once Nix is installed, navigate to the project's root directory (where the `shell.nix` file is located) in your terminal and run:

```bash
nix-shell
```

This command will build or download the necessary dependencies defined in `shell.nix` and drop you into a new shell with these dependencies available. You should see a welcome message from the `shellHook`.

## Running the Project Scripts

Inside the Nix shell, you can execute the project's Python scripts as you normally would. Here are some examples:

*   **To run the data processor:**
    ```bash
    python data_processor.py
    ```

*   **To run the model trainer:**
    ```bash
    python model_trainer.py
    ```

*   **To run the predictor:**
    ```bash
    python predictor_lay_aoav.py
    ```

    *(Adjust the script names if they are different or if they require specific arguments.)*

## Additional Notes

*   The `shell.nix` file provides the main Python dependencies (requests, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib).
*   As mentioned in the `shellHook` message, if you prefer to use `pip` for managing additional packages or for more isolated virtual environments within the Nix shell, you can create and activate a standard Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Or install other packages
    ```
    Remember that the core dependencies are already provided by Nix, so using `pip` for those might be redundant unless you need very specific versions not managed by your Nix channels.

```
